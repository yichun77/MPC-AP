Developed advanced MPC algorithms for artificial pancreas systems designed to serve both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes patients. The work involved dynamic modeling of glucose-insulin interactions, real-time prediction of glucose levels, and adaptive control strategies to accommodate diverse physiological profiles and treatment needs. The algorithms were optimized for robust performance across varying insulin sensitivities, meal intakes, and daily routines, aiming to support safer and more effective automated insulin delivery.
